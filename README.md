# OL-Results
This repository contains result tables and figures to complement the article entitled:
"An Opposition-Inspired Learning Strategy to Focus the Search Process of Ant-based Algorithms"


1) Matrices directory:

Initial and final pheromone matrices obtained by Ant Knapsack (AK), SOL-AK, HOL-AK and WOL-AK
for the instance #7 from the set 5x500 (tr=0.50).

- Init*.png: Initial pheromone matrices for Ant Knapsack. 
In the case of OL approaches figures show initial matrices generated after the First Step.

- Fin*.png: Final pheromone matrices of Ant Knapsack.
Figures show the final pheromone matrices after the whole execution of Ant Knapsack.

2) Tables directory:

These files contains the obtained results for the three sets of instances: 5x500, 10x500, 30x500.
For each set: 
- the percentage gap between the best known and the best quality solution (Gap(Best)),
- the percentage gap between the best known and the average of 30 independent executions,
are presented.
