# OL-Results
This repository contains boxplots, result tables, convergence plots and figures to complement the article entitled:
"An Opposition-Inspired Learning Strategy to Focus the Search Process of Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms"




1) Tables directory:

These files contains the obtained results for the three sets of instances: 5x500, 10x500, 30x500.
For each set: 
- the percentage gap between the best known and the best quality solution (Gap(Best)),
- the percentage gap between the best known and the average of 30 independent executions,
are presented.

2) Convergence plots:
For each method, a convergence plot is presented, considering 10.000 evaluations.

3) Boxplots:
This directory contains boxplots for each instance of the ORLIB, for the three sets of instances: 5x500, 10x500, 30x500. Here, the percentage gap between Ant Knapsack and SOL, WOL and HOL is presented.
